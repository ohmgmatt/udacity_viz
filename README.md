## Design
During my initial exploration of the data, I thought that a scatter plot of
the height and weight of a player on the x and y axis would be the best way to
show this graphic. I would have included one of HR or 'avg' as the radius of
the circle. To go further, I would have either used an interactive graph to
make transitions to the other performance variable or I would have used a color
scale to show the 2nd variable. This quickly created a jumbled mess and did
not create an easily legible graphic. I could not pull anything worth digesting
from it. I quickly decided to switch from a bivariate analysis to a univariate
one. This led to my first iteration of bar charts and comparison of each.

## Feedback
Bryan M: Make the graph labels for the axis bigger, it is kind of small for
me. Also I don't know what the value for the heights are. Are they in inches?

Gretchen B: Personally I'd like to see some visuals to show what graph I'm
looking at when I click the buttons. When I click the buttons, I got confused as
to which graph I was looking at. Could you color code the buttons somehow?

Alyson Q: To make it consistent, make 'avg' on the y axis capitalized like
everything else. Also, just stylistically, do you think you could order the
second chart like "L, B, R" to match the hands?
