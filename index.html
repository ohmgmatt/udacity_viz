    <h1>Performance of Baseball Players</h1>

    <h2>Physical Appearances and Performance</h2>

    <p class='paragraph' id = 'first-text'>
      In our dataset, we see that we have 1000+ players with a large range of
      height and weight and their respective performance through their batting
      average and amount of home runs hit. Below are four graphs that explore
      the relationship between height/weight and home runs/batting averages.

    <div class = 'flex'>
      <div class = 'chart' id ='chart1'></div>
      <div class = 'buttons' id ='set1'>Graph Adjuster</div>
    </div>

    <p class='paragraph' id = 'second-text'>
      From the graphics, we can see that there was a small trend downward in
      batting averages as the players height increase. This could be due to a
      smaller sample of players who are 6' 5" or higher. Batting averages by
      weight also produce a similar, though more diffucult to see graph. There
      are random spikes in the graph. This could be a single player doing really
      well and raising the average for a small sample. Finally, when we look at
      graphics involving the average amount of home runs per height, it gets
      very difficult to see any relationship between a persons' physical
      appearance and how well they perform on average.
