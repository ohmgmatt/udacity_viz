    <h1>Performance of Baseball Players</h1>

    <h2>Physical Appearances and Performance</h2>

    <p class='paragraph' id = 'first-text'>
      In our dataset, we see that we have 1000+ players with a large range of
      height and weight and their respective performance through their batting
      average and amount of home runs hit. Below are four graphs that explore
      the relationship between height/weight and home runs/batting averages.
