    <h1>Performance of Baseball Players</h1>

    <h2>Physical Appearances and Performance</h2>

    <p class='paragraph' id = 'first-text'>
      In our dataset, we see that we have 1000+ players with a large range of
      height and weight and their respective performance through their batting
      average and amount of home runs hit. Below are four graphs that explore
      the relationship between height/weight and home runs/batting averages.
    </p>

    <div class = 'flex'>
      <div class = 'chart' id ='chart1'></div>
      <div class = 'buttons' id ='set1'>
        <p class = 'button-title'>Graph Adjusters</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class='paragraph' id = 'second-text'>
      From the graphics, we can see that there was a small trend downward in
      batting averages as the players height increase. This could be due to a
      smaller sample of players who are 6' 5" or higher. Batting averages by
      weight also produce a similar, though more diffucult to see graph. There
      are random spikes in the graph. This could be a single player doing really
      well and raising the average for a small sample. Finally, when we look at
      graphics involving the average amount of home runs per height, it gets
      very difficult to see any relationship between a persons' physical
      appearance and how well they perform on average.

    <h2>Handy Baseball Players</h2>

    <p class='paragraph' id = 'third-text'>
      Luckily, our dataset also included the 'handedness' of a person. In short,
      it tells us whether a person was left-handed (L), right-handed (R), or
      ambidextrous (B). The graphs below show the amount of players there are for
      each 'handedness' and then their respective averages of home runs and
      batting averages.
    </p>

    <div class = 'flex'>
      <div class = 'chart' id = 'chart2'></div>
      <div class = 'buttons' id = 'set2'>
        <p class = 'button-title'>Graph Adjusters</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class='paragraph' id ='fourth-text'>
      From the amount of players, we can see that the amount of right-handed
      players more than doubles the amount of left-handed players and more than
      7x the amount of ambidextrous players. This is expected since a large
      portion of people are right handed.</br>
      What is shocking, however, is how right-handed people perform considerably
      less than left-handed or ambidextrous people. Looking at the average
      amount of home runs, right-handed people are second to left-handed people
      on an average of 13 home runs less. On average batting averages, right-
      handed people perform the least of the three.
